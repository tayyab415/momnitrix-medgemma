=== LOW RISK EXAMPLES ===

Example 1 | row_index=505
--- PROMPT ---
Evaluate the following pregnancy vitals and determine risk level:

Patient profile:
- 17 years old, G1P0
- Gestation: week 21 (2nd trimester)
- BMI group: normal

Monitoring data (smartwatch + app logs):
- BP: 70/50 mmHg
- Fasting glucose: 7.9 mmol/L
- Body temp: 98.0°F
- Resting pulse: 70 bpm

Please return:
1) LOW/MID/HIGH risk classification
2) Clinical interpretation tied to threshold values
3) Likely maternal-fetal complications
4) Week-21 appropriate management actions
5) Immediate red-flag symptoms
--- RESPONSE ---
RISK LEVEL: LOW

Clinical Assessment: blood pressure of 70/50 mmHg is outside ideal pregnancy range and should be trended closely; fasting glucose of 7.9 mmol/L is above the normal fasting threshold of 5.1 and needs closer metabolic follow-up; while this row is labeled low risk, specific findings warrant closer surveillance: blood pressure is in a marked hypotensive range; glucose level is substantially elevated for fasting pregnancy targets. At gestational week 21, continue routine prenatal monitoring with attention to trend changes.

Potential Complications: Current data do not indicate immediate severe complications, but monitor for possible gestational diabetes, maternal hemodynamic instability, gestational diabetes.

Recommended Actions:
- Follow fetal movement awareness guidance as gestation advances
- Continue routine prenatal visits and standard trimester screening
- Maintain balanced nutrition and hydration with regular light activity
- Keep sleep and stress routines stable to support cardiovascular health

Warning Signs: Watch for increasing urination, persistent severe headache, reduced fetal movement. Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.

--- RESPONSE ---
RISK LEVEL: LOW

Clinical Assessment: blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg is within expected pregnancy range (about 90-129 systolic and 60-84 diastolic); fasting glucose of 7.5 mmol/L is above the normal fasting threshold of 5.1 and needs closer metabolic follow-up; while this row is labeled low risk, specific findings warrant closer surveillance: advanced maternal age increases baseline obstetric risk. At 21 weeks gestation, findings support ongoing surveillance and prevention-focused care.

Potential Complications: possible gestational diabetes, placental complications, hypertensive disorders.

Recommended Actions:
- Keep sleep and stress routines stable to support cardiovascular health
- Continue routine prenatal visits and standard trimester screening
- Follow fetal movement awareness guidance as gestation advances
- Track BP, glucose, and heart rate trends weekly in the app

Warning Signs: Watch for reduced fetal movement, increasing urination, increasing thirst. Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.

--- RESPONSE ---
RISK LEVEL: LOW

Clinical Assessment: blood pressure of 80/60 mmHg is outside ideal pregnancy range and should be trended closely; fasting glucose of 7.5 mmol/L is above the normal fasting threshold of 5.1 and needs closer metabolic follow-up; while this row is labeled low risk, specific findings warrant closer surveillance: blood pressure is in a marked hypotensive range; very young maternal age increases preterm and hypertensive risk. At 19 weeks gestation, findings support ongoing surveillance and prevention-focused care.

Potential Complications: possible gestational diabetes, maternal hemodynamic instability, preterm labor risk.

Recommended Actions:
- Maintain balanced nutrition and hydration with regular light activity
- Follow fetal movement awareness guidance as gestation advances
- Continue routine prenatal visits and standard trimester screening
- Keep sleep and stress routines stable to support cardiovascular health

Warning Signs: Watch for persistent severe headache, reduced fetal movement, vaginal bleeding. Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.
